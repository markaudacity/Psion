# Psion
Various bits and bobs for the Psion Organiser II PDA
## Replacement Parts
### Datapak Case
This is a reproduction of the Psion Datapak/Rampak shell, with slight tweaks for printability. I've tested both the shell and the lid with the original parts, and they interchange in both directions. It's challenging to reproduce the tight tolerances of an injection-molded part on an FDM printer, so the lid is a little loose, but it does stay put well enough that the Pak will stay together in a computer bag or a pocket.

## Labels
### Datapak Labels
Inner and outer labels for Datapaks. I haven't had a chance to print these out yet, but a sticker is a sticker, pretty much.
